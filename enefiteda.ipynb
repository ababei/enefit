Correlations between different timeseries\n\nAnother thing we can notice from the initial plots is that the series seems to be correlated; in particular, if we fixing a county, product type and bussiness value, the consumption should fall when energy is generated, and vice-versa. In the following, we explore two correlation matrices: one as above, between series that have the same county, product type and bussiness value (so they either describe energy generation vs. energy consumption), and one between series that have a fixed ('is_business', 'is_consumption', 'product_type') tuple, so they have varying counties.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.
